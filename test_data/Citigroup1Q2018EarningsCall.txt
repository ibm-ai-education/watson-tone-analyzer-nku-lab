Earlier today, we reported operating earnings of $4.6 billion for the first quarter of 2018 or $1.68 per share. Our quarter showed strong and balanced performance as we continued to capture client led growth. And, we remain on track to deliver on the targets we announced at Investor Day.

Our earnings per share were 24% higher than one year ago as a result of strong business performance, a lower tax rate, and a continued reduction in shares outstanding as we execute our capital return plans. Relative to a year ago, we grew revenues by 3%, improved our efficiency ratio to just under 58%, increased our return on assets to 98 basis points, and improved our return on tangible common equity to 11.4%. We grew loans in our core businesses by 7%, or $44 billion, from last year. We ended the quarter with over $1 trillion in deposits.

Global Consumer Banking had a good all-around quarter, with 6% revenue growth and positive operating leverage in every region. In the US, we continued to make progress with our Citigold Wealth Management offering, and also had growth in retail services. In branded cards, we saw the underlying revenue growth that we projected, driven by an increase in interest earning balances and strong client engagement. In Mexico and Asia, we saw a momentum in both retail banking and cards.

Our Institutional Clients Group had another solid quarter. While fixed income revenues were lower than a year ago, driven by less investor activity, our equities business saw its best quarter in many years, giving us confidence that our investments are delivering results. We also saw ongoing momentum in TTS, our private bank, corporate lending, and securities services as we continued to grow these stable accrual type businesses. While investment banking revenue was down, we held on to the wallet share gains we made in recent years and client engagement remains strong.

In addition to improving our return on capital, we continued to make progress in improving the return of capital for our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned over $3 billion in capital to our shareholders, helping to reduce our common shares outstanding by over $200 million shares from one year ago, or 7%.

We will complete our current $19 billion capital return plan in the second quarter, and we recently submitted our plan for the 2018 CCAR cycle. We believe we remain on track to meet the commitment we outlined at Investor Day of returning at least $60 billion over the 2017, '18, and '19 cycles, subject of course to regulatory approval.

The environment remains unique, to say the least. We had synchronized global growth in a macro economic environment, which is as positive as we've seen since before the financial crisis. US corporations are starting to see the benefits of tax reform, the labor market is tight, and wage growth continues to improve. At the same time, though, there are concurrently escalating and deescalating tensions, depending on the day in geography. And, while our markets business may appreciate the volatility, we'd be better served by steady and predictable growth and having our fundamentally robust economy do its thing.

Starting on Slide 3, net income of $4.6 billion in the first quarter grew 13% from last year as growth in operating margin was partially offset by higher credit costs and we benefited from a significantly lower tax rate. EPS grew 24%, including the impact of a 7% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.

Revenues of $18.9 billion grew 3% from the prior year, reflecting 7% aggregate growth in our consumer and institutional businesses, offset by lower revenues in corp/other as we continued to wind down legacy assets. Expenses increased 2% year-over-year as higher volume related expenses and investments were partially offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets.

Our efficiency ratio is 57.9% for the quarter, roughly 50 basis better than last year, representing the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year efficiency improvement. And cost of credit increased, mostly driven by the institutional business as well as volume growth and seasoning in consumer. Our return on assets was 98 basis points for the quarter, and RoTCE improved to 11.4%.

In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 6% year-over-year to $673 billion, as 7% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in corp/other. GCB and ICG loans grew by $44 billion in total, with contribution from every region in consumer as well as TTS, the private bank and traditional corporate lending.

Turning now to each business, Slide 4 shows the results for global consumer banking in constant dollars. Net income grew 37% in the first quarter, driven by operating margin and EBIT growth in each region, as well as the lower tax rate. Total revenues of $8.4 billion grew 6% year-over-year, and were up 4% excluding the impact of the Hilton portfolio sale, which resulted in a gain this quarter, partially offset by the loss of operating revenues for a net benefit of about $120 million in our US branded cards business.

From a product perspective, global retail banking revenues grew 6% in the first quarter, reflecting growth in loans and AUMs, even as we continued to shrink our physical branch footprint. And, global cards delivered 3% revenue growth, excluding Hilton, driven by continued growth in loans and purchase sales in every region.

Slide 5 shows the results for North America consumer in more detail. First quarter revenues of $5.2 billion were up 4% from last year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew 4% year-over-year. Mortgage revenues continued to decline, mostly reflecting lower origination activity and higher funding costs; however, we more than offset this pressure with growth in the rest of our franchise. Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 8%, driven by continued growth in deposit margins, growth in investments and loans, and increased commercial banking activity.

Average deposits declined 2% year-over-year, including the impact of lower mortgage escrow deposits. We generated 2% growth in checking deposits this quarter, driven largely by our Citigold segment. However, this is more than offset by a reduction in money market balances as clients put more money to work in investments. In keeping with this focus on wealth management, assets under management up 10% year-over-year to $61 billion. We continue to see positive momentum in Citigold with continued growth in both households and balances, with improving penetration of investment products.

And, we're continuing to drive our digital transformation as well. As part of our Mobile-First strategy, we've been developing capabilities to enhance the experience of our clients, and we're now at a point where we can leverage these digital capabilities to acquire and service a broader range of retail banking customers. Our recently announced launch of national digital banking is key to this next step in our transformation, designed to meet all of a client's needs through mobile banking, including the ability to seamlessly open a new Citibank retail account within the mobile app.

We believe these capabilities will allow us to expand beyond our core markets and build a national presence. But, we recognize that this buildout will take time. New features will begin to roll out toward the end of the second quarter, followed by a promotional campaign beginning in the third quarter.

Turning to branded cards, revenues were roughly flat from last year, excluding the previously mentioned impact of the sale of the Hilton portfolio. Client engagement remains strong with average loans growing by 5% and purchase sales up 8% year-over-year. We continue to generate growth in total interest earning balances this quarter, up about 6% year-over-year, excluding Hilton, as recent vintages continue to mature as expected, partially offset by the runoff of non-core balances.

Excluding the impact of additional partnership terms that went into effect in January, we delivered roughly 2% underlying revenue growth in our US branded cards business this quarter, consistent with our full year 2018 outlook.

Finally, retail services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 2% driven by higher average loans. Total expenses for North America consumer were up 2% as higher volume-related expenses and investments were partially offset by efficiency savings. We continued to drive transaction volumes to lower cost channels, and digital engagement remains strong with a 13% increase in total active digital users, including 25% growth among mobile users versus last year.

Turning to credit, net credit losses grew by 9% year-over-year and we built roughly $119 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, each driven by volume growth and normal seasoning. Our NCL rate in U.S. branded cards was 304 basis points, in line with an NCL rate in the range of 3% for 2018. And, in Retail Services, our NCL rate was 518 basis points, which is also consistent with our outlook for an NCL rate in the range of 5% basis points for 2018.

On Slide 6, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. First quarter revenues of $3.3 billion grew by 8% with contribution from every business and region. In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 8%. Retail banking revenues grew 7% in the first quarter, driven by growth in loans and deposits as well as improved deposit spreads. And, card revenues grew 13% on continued growth in purchase sales and full rate revolving loans as well as a favorable prior period comparison.

Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 7% year-over-year in the first quarter, and were up 6% excluding the benefit of a modest one-time gain. Excluding the gain, retail banking grew 6% driven by our wealth management business, reflecting favorable market conditions. Card revenues grew 5% on continued growth in loans and purchase sales. In total, operating expenses grew 5% in the first quarter as investment spending and volume-driven growth were partially offset by efficiency savings. And, cost of credit was essentially flat.

Slide 7 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail by region. Credit continued to be broadly favorable again this quarter. In North America, the NCL rate increased sequentially, reflecting seasonality and cards while delinquencies remained stable. And trends remained stable to improving in Mexico and Asia as well.

Turning now to the institutional clients group on Slide 8. Revenues of $9.8 billion increased 6% from last year, driven by continued momentum in our accrual businesses as well as a very strong performance in equities this quarter. Total Banking revenues of $4.8 billion grew 6%. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2.3 billion were up 8%, reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit spreads with solid growth across both net interest and fee income. Investment banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 10% from last year, generally in line with the overall market and reflecting the timing of episodic deal activity. Private bank revenues of $904 million grew 21% year-over-year, driven by growth in clients, loans, investments and deposits, as well as improved deposit spreads. And corporate lending revenues of $521 million were up 19%, reflecting loan growth as well as lower hedging costs.

Total markets and securities services revenues of $5 billion grew 3% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $3.4 billion declined 7% year-over-year. Corporate client activity remained strong, driving growth in G10 FX, and local markets' rates and currencies. However, this was more than offset by lower investor client activity and a less favorable environment in G10 rates and spread products, in particular in March.

Equities revenues were up 38%, with growth across all products as volatility trended higher and we saw continued momentum with investor clients, in line with our investment strategy. Finally, in securities services, revenues were up 16% driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue.

Total operating expenses of $5.5 billion increased 7% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of FX translation as well as a higher level of investment spending. And finally, cost of credit was a benefit this quarter, driven by net ratings upgrades and continued stability in commodity prices.

Slide 9 shows the results for corporate/other. Revenues of $591 million declined 51% from last year, driven by the wind down of legacy assets. Expenses were down 35%, also reflecting the wind down. And the pre-tax loss in corp/other was $143 million this quarter, slightly better than our outlook, mostly due to a greater benefit from legacy asset sales. Looking ahead, we believe an outlook for pre-tax losses 20 the range of around $200-250 million per quarter in corp/other is a fair run rate for the remainder of 2018. This is an improvement from our prior outlook for quarterly losses in the range of $250-300 million based on somewhat higher treasury revenues given the higher rate environment as well as the lower expenses.

Slide 10 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends, split by core accrual revenue, trading-related revenue, and the contribution from our legacy assets in corp/other. As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.2 billion this quarter grew slightly from last year. Core accrual net interest revenues grew by $750 million, but this was largely offset by lower trading related net interest revenue as well as the anticipated wind down of legacy assets.

On a sequential basis, core accrual revenues grew slightly, reflecting the December rate hike as well as loan growth, partially offset by the impact of the lower day count. Our core accrual net interest margin improved by eight basis points to 354 basis points, driven by the rate increase, loan growth, and lower average cash balances as we use liquidity to fund higher yielding assets. On a full year basis, we now expect core accrual net interest revenue to grow by over $2.7 billion in 2018 as we vetted the impact of the recent March rate hike to our original outlook, which had called for $2.5 billion of growth, assuming only one fed rate increase in June.

Legacy asset related net interest revenues should continue to decline by about $500 million this year as we wind down that portfolio. And, trading related net interest revenue will likely continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment as we saw in the first quarter.

On slide 11, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 12.1% this quarter due to an increase in RWA, driven by loan growth and client activity, as well as $3 billion of common share buybacks and dividends, partially offset by net income. Our tangible book value per share, increased to $61.00.

In summary, we made good progress toward our longer-term goal this quarter, with solid revenue growth, positive operating leverage, and a significant improvement in net income and returns. Looking to the second quarter for total Citigroup, we expect topline growth to continue broadly in line with the pace we set this quarter, at around 3% plus or minus with stronger growth in our operating businesses being offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets.

Operating efficiency should again show progress against the prior year period with more significant improvement to come in the second half of the year. Cost of credit should increase quarter-over-quarter, assuming that credit normalizes in ICG. And the tax rate should be closer to 25%.

Turning to the businesses in more detail, in consumer we expect continued revenue growth in US retail banking, retail services, Mexico, and Asia. In US branded cards, as described earlier, excluding Hilton, we expect continued underlying revenue growth as loan balances are maturing as expected. However, this should continue to be largely offset by the impact of additional partnership terms that went into effect in January. And, of course, we will also see a year-over-year impact from the sale of the Hilton portfolio.

On the instructional side, markets revenues should reflect the overall operating environment. However, we would typically expect a seasonal decline in trading revenues from the first quarter. Investment banking revenues should improve quarter-over-quarter, assuming favorable market conditions. And, we expect continued revenue growth in our accrual businesses, TTS, corporate lending, private bank, and security services as we continue to serve our target clients across our global network.

In addition, we're looking forward to receiving our CCAR results late in the second quarter. At Investor Day last year, we stated our goal of returning at least $20 billion of capital to shareholders as part of the 2018 CCAR process. And, subject to regulatory approval, we believe we remain on track to do so.
