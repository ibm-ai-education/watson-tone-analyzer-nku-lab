2018 began on a very strong footing. In the first quarter, firm revenues and net income were a record, $11.1 billion and $2.7 billion respectively. The ROE of 14.9% comfortable exceeded our targets, albeit in what is typically a seasonally strong quarter. Importantly, the quarter’s performance demonstrated our inherent operating leverage in an attractive market environment. Results across all businesses were consistently strong.

Our sales and trading businesses performed exceptionally well against the backdrop of heightened volatility and client activity. Equity Sales & Trading benefited from strong volumes across all regions. Return volatility in rates and FX markets provided clients with an opportunity and a catalyst to rebalance their portfolios. This activity combined with the rise in U.S. interest rates and changes in inflation expectations contributed to strong fixed income results. We remain appropriately sized to take advantage of active markets when they present themselves. Investment banking demonstrated sustained strength despite new issue markets being punctuated by periods of elevated volatility.

Wealth management remains solid. For the quarter, the combination of continued advisory growth supported by secular trends and the businesses scale driven operating leverage produced record pretax profit of $1.2 billion. This represents an almost 20% year-on-year increase in PBT with the margin and the range we set to achieve out of the 2 years. At the same time, we continue to actively invest in the business building out our digital offerings, banking products and technology capabilities more broadly.

Investment management again witnessed net long-term inflows over the quarter as the team continues to produce strong investment returns across both alternatives and public markets. We expect attractive returns from investment management in the years ahead particularly as we take advantage of our global platform. In the quarter, we closed the Mesa West acquisition and made several key highs. We have often said that wealth and investment management give us balance and our other businesses make up the engine that drives this going forward in more active markets. That is exactly what we witnessed in the first quarter. For the past several years, a lot of focus has been put on the importance of the stability that wealth management has brought to our firm. This focus has been appropriate. Margins of 26.5% on revenues of $4.4 billion would have been unthinkable just 3 years ago.

However, what is not being discussed as often is our continued commitment to strengthen the institutional securities businesses. In institutional securities alone, the dominance of equities, the strength of fixed income and the breadth of investment banking generated over $6 billion in revenue. Along with the rest of the industry, we recently submitted our 2018 CCAR plan. As is being widely reported, this year’s scenario is more severe than previous years. Of course we don’t have full transparency into the Fed models, but over the years we have seen a reasonable degree of variability. Therefore we are prepared for a range of outcomes this year.

More importantly, beyond this year the Fed Reserve has recently requested comments on several proposed rulemakings. We expect that we and the U.S. financial sector more broadly will benefit from more sensible and less complex regulation. We believe we have sufficiently capitalized and expect to maintain our attractive capital return profiles over the coming years. As we look forward our objectives remain the same to execute on our strategy and deliver on the medium-term goals laid out at the beginning of this year. I am confident that given our business model makes and the competitive strength of our global franchise we are very well-positioned.
