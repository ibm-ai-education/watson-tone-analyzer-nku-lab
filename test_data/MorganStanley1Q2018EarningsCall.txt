2018 began on a very strong footing. In the first quarter, firm revenues and net income were a record -- $11.1 billion and $2.7 billion respectively. The ROE of 14.9% comfortably exceeded our targets, albeit in what is typically a seasonally strong quarter. Importantly, the quarter's performance demonstrated our inherent operating leverage in an attractive market environment. Results across all businesses were consistently strong.

Our Sales and Training businesses performed exceptionally well against a backdrop of heightened volatility and client activity. Equity Sales and Trading benefited from strong volumes across all regions. Return volatility in rates and FX markets provided clients with an opportunity and a catalyst to rebalance their portfolios. This activity, combined with the rising U.S. interest rates and changes in inflation expectations, contributed to strong fixed-income results. We remain appropriately sized to take advantage of active markets when they present themselves.

Investment Banking demonstrated sustained strength despite new-issue markets being punctuated by periods of elevated volatility. Wealth Management remained solid. For the quarter, a combination of continued advisory growth supported by secular trends and the business' scale-driven operating leverage produced record pre-tax profit of $1.2 billion. This represents an almost 20% year-on-year increase in PBT with the margin and the range we set to achieve over the next two years. At the same time, we continue to actively invest in the business, building out our digital offerings, banking products, and technology capabilities more broadly.

Investment Management again witnessed net long-term inflows over the quarter as the team continues to produce strong investment returns across both alternatives and public markets. We expect attractive returns from investment management in the years ahead, particularly as we take advantage of our global platform. In the quarter, we closed the Mesa West acquisition and made several key hires.

We've often said that wealth and investment management give us ballast, and our other businesses make up the engine that drives this firm forward in more active markets. That is exactly what we witnessed in the first quarter. For the past several years, a lot of focus has been put on the importance of the stability that wealth management has brought to our firm. This focus has been appropriate. Margins of 26.5% on revenues of $4.4 billion would have been unthinkable just three years ago. However, what has not been discussed as often is our continued commitment to strengthen the Institutional Securities businesses. In Institutional Securities alone, the dominance of Equities, the strength of Fixed Income, and the breadth of Investment Banking generated over $6 billion in revenue.

Along with the rest of the industry, we recently submitted our 2018 CCAR plan. As has been widely reported, this year's scenario is more severe than previous years. Of course, we don't have full transparency into the Fed models, but over the years, we've seen a reasonable degree of variability. Therefore, we're prepared for a range of outcomes this year. More importantly, beyond this year, the Federal Reserve has recently requested comments on several proposed rulemakings. We expect that we -- and the U.S. financial sector more broadly -- will benefit from more sensible and less complex regulation. We believe we are sufficiently capitalized and expect to maintain our attractive capital return profiles over coming years.

As we look forward, our objectives remain the same: To execute on our strategy and deliver on the medium-term goals laid out at the beginning of this year. I'm confident that given our business model, mix, and the competitive strength of our global franchise, we're very well positioned.
 The first quarter's results were strong across businesses and regions. Global markets were active. Our Institutional Securities businesses benefited from increased trading volumes and the return of healthy volatility across many asset classes. Our wealth and investment management businesses delivered solid results, weathering softer asset prices. Revenues were up 17% sequentially to $11.1 billion, a firm record after excluding the impact of DVA in prior periods. PBT was $3.4 billion, EPS was $1.45, ROE was 14.9%, and return on tangible common equity was 17.2%.

Total noninterest expense was $7.7 billion, up 10% year over year. The increase was driven by a combination of higher compensation expenses and execution-related costs associated with higher revenues and business volumes respectively. Continued investments into technology also contributed to the increase. Over that same period, revenue growth was 14%. In the quarter, the firm efficiency ratio was 69%, with all segments contributing to strong operating leverage. The gross-up impact of the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition was not material at the firm level. The details are more fully described in the quarterly supplement.

Now, to the businesses. Institutional Securities generated revenues of $6.1 billion. This represents a 35% sequential increase and the best performance for the segment as a whole since 2007. Investment Banking, Equities, and Fixed Income all contributed to the results. Non-compensation expenses were $1.8 billion for the quarter, a 6% increase, driven by higher execution expenses. Compensation expenses were $2.2 billion, representing a compensation-to-net-revenue ratio of 35.4%.

In Investment Banking, we generated revenues of $1.5 billion, a 5% increase over our strong fourth quarter. The results reflect the combination of increased advisory revenues and stability in underwriting. All regions demonstrated strength. Advisory revenues for the quarter were $574 million, up 10% sequentially. Announced M&A volumes have had a strong start to the year. Notably, there has been a pickup in both larger and cross-border transactions. Clients remain engaged and pipelines are healthy.

Turning to underwriting, new-issue market conditions were more challenged during periods in the quarter. Despite bouts of heightened equity volatility, rising interest rates, and wider credit spreads, results remain solid. Equity underwriting revenues of $421 million were up 1% sequentially. The market backdrop impacted our ability to convert some of our IPO backlog, but follow-on activity remained robust. Regionally, we witnessed strength in Asia and the Americas. We also saw issuers take advantage of higher volatility through increased convertible issuance.

Fixed Income underwriting revenues increased 4% sequentially to $518 million. A decrease in high-yield financing was offset by increased investment-grade issuance. This was supported in part by event-driven activity, including one large financing we provided together with our partner, MUFG. Overall, Investment Banking pipelines remain healthy and diversified across products, regions, and sectors. However, as demonstrated by recent market dynamics, future activity may be impacted by regulatory, macroeconomic, and geopolitical factors.

Our Sales and Trading businesses produced revenues of $4.4 billion, up 64% quarter over quarter. Increased market activity, strong client engagement, and more favorable bid offer spreads -- particularly during the first half of the quarter -- drove the improvement in results. In Equities, we retained our leadership position and expect to be No. 1 globally. Revenues were $2.6 billion, up 33% sequentially, on strengths across all products and all regions.

Derivatives had a very strong quarter as episodes of volatility created significant trading activity and strong client demand for hedging solutions. A combination of higher client balances and increased engagement generated a sequential rise in prime rate brokerage revenues. And, cash revenues also saw a quarter-over-quarter increase, benefiting from strong volumes globally, particularly in Europe and Asia.

Fixed-income was also strong. Revenues in the first quarter were $1.9 billion, more than doubling fourth-quarter results. While seasonal patterns were a contributing factor, the sharp rise in interest rates in the early part of the quarter, heightened volatility levels, and the rise in inflation expectations aided activity and our performance. Our macro business performance was solid, driven by improved sequential performance across rates and FX. The credit businesses performed well. Our securitized product group had one of its best quarters in close to four years, driven by strength in Europe and a more active trading backdrop. Deepening our institutional lending footprint has aided this revenue stream.

Commodity revenues were also strong. The results benefited from both an increase in flow activity and more structured transactions, which can be episodic. Fixed-income results demonstrate the operational flex in the business and the segment's ability to service clients in a range of market environments. Average trading vol for the period was $46 million, up from $38 million in the fourth quarter 2017. The increase was driven by higher market volatility and facilitation of increased client activity.

Turning to Wealth Management, revenues of $4.4 billion were down 1% quarter over quarter as continued growth in asset management was offset by the impact of mark-to-market undeferred compensation plan investments. Despite lower sequential revenues, the segment produced record pre-tax profit of $1.2 billion, resulting in a PBT margin of 26.5%. The 40 basis points of sequential margin increase and 250 basis point uplift compared to last year's first quarter demonstrates the operating leverage in this scale business. On a year-over-year basis, non-compensation expenses were flat despite an 8% growth in revenues.

Total client assets were essentially unchanged at $2.4 trillion, reflecting softness in domestic and international equity indices. Fee-based assets continue to be a source of long-term organic growth for the business, supported by both conversions from brokerage and net new asset flows into the firm. Net fee-based asset flows of $18 billion were strong. As a result, fee-based assets reached a new high of $1.1 trillion or 45% of total client assets.

Asset management revenues were $2.5 billion. Positive flows and last quarter's higher asset levels were partially offset by the effect of fewer calendar days in the quarter. Net interest income was $1.1 billion. Higher average balances and yields were offset by an increase in funding costs, driven primarily by higher rates on our deposits. Lower sweep deposit balances also impacted NII as retail clients have continued to deploy cash into the market. Cash in our clients' accounts remains at historic lows and equity allocations remain at historic highs, hovering around 54% of client assets.

On a year-over-year basis, net interest income is up 8%. This has been driven primarily by an increase in wealth management and lending in the U.S. banks. Loan balances are up $6.7 billion or 11%, with growth across both SPL and mortgage. In the quarter, loans grew by 1% to $68.3 billion. The more modest pace of sequential loan growth was driven by rising rates, steepening paydowns, and a lower level of mortgage reduction as we transition to our in-house origination platform. Retail engagement was strong in the quarter as investors actively repositioned portfolios and responded to market volatility. However, total transaction revenues of $747 million were down 5%, driven principally by the impact of mark-to-market undeferred compensation plans.

This quarter's results underscore the ability of the segment. Despite gyrations in equity markets and our pace of investment, pre-tax profit reached new highs. We continue to pursue enhancements to our digital capabilities, and we're continuously introducing new applications to the organization. Over time, we believe that these advancements will enable our advisors to provide better advice and service and broaden their client relationships.

In Investment Management, revenues were $718 million, up 13% sequentially, driven by higher asset management fees and the absence of last quarter's impairment charge. Total AUM of $469 billion was down 3% quarter over quarter, with long-term AUM of $312 billion up 2% quarter over quarter. Although we saw outflows in our liquidity business as clients managed their cash balance needs around the turn of the year, our long-term strategy saw continued positive flows. In the quarter, we also closed the Mesa West acquisition, adding private real estate credit capabilities to our platform.

Asset management fees of $326 million were up 9% sequentially on the back of higher-average AUM for the quarter. We continue to see stability in fee rates earned on our long-term assets. Investment revenues were $77 million, down by 31% relative to last quarter, impacted by lower market performance in certain private-equity-related funds. Total expenses increased by 2% quarter over quarter, largely driven by the revenue recognition gross-up related to the segment.

Turning to the balance sheet, on a sequential basis, total spot assets of $860 billion was essentially flat. As a result of higher lending commitment supporting relationship and event activity in the quarter, our standardized RWAs grew by approximately $12 billion to $389 billion. Our Basel III standardized Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is expected to decrease to 15.6%. Our supplementary leverage ratio is expected to remain relatively unchanged at 6.3%

During the fourth quarter, we purchased approximately $1.25 billion of common stock or approximately 22 million shares, and our board declared a $0.25 dividend per share. This morning, we announced a share repurchase plan with MUFG. As part of our regular repurchase program, we will make pro rata purchases directly from MUFG. This will help ensure compliance with their passivity commitments to the Federal Reserve by maintaining their ownership below 24.9%. This will not impact our strategic alliance.

Our tax rate in the first quarter was 20.9%, reflecting the reduced U.S. corporate tax rate and benefits associated with share-based payments. Our guidance for the full year remains at 22% to 25%. The vast majority of share-based award conversions took place in the first quarter. We expect the tax rate for the remaining quarters to be at the upper end of this range.

This quarter demonstrates the strength of our franchise and the benefit of our global business model. As we look forward, we remain confident that we are well-positioned to execute the medium-term strategic objectives that we laid out earlier this year. In the near term, we are aware of the fragility of market sentiment. We have emphasized the importance of open and functioning markets as it relates to our performance. This quarter's results demonstrate that increased levels of activity and client engagement are broadly beneficial to our business. With that, we will now open the line to questions.
